# Abstraction
Describe complex problems in simple terms, by ignoring details.  
Eliminating the nitty-gritty details let us focus on the bigger picture. W can dig deeper once we have a broader understanding. How does abstaction work?  

If I said "cat", you can understand we are talking about cat, no matter it's kitten, a big cat, a male cat, a black cat ... We are naturally goot at generalizing things. Abstraction work same way in object-oriented programming. When we define a class, we focus on the essential qualities of that class. 

Back to Pokemon example, we start with simple attributes and methods, we do not include details like age, weight and height which is not necessary. Or we should include some deeper detail that make us can not generalizing things.
