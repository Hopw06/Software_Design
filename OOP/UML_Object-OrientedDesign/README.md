# Object-Oriented Design and the Unified Modeling Language

This repository contains documents on the course: [Get started with Object-Oriented Design and the Unified Modeling Language (UML). Use UML for effective communication!](https://www.udemy.com/course/uml-and-object-oriented-design-foundations/)

At first, I learned about two software development methodologies which include Waterfall model and Agile Approach.

Next, I studied the core concepts about object oriented programming which include Object, Class, Abstraction, Encapsulation and Data hiding, Inheritance and Polymorphism.

Next, I continued with some basic step about object oriented analysis and design. 

Then, I learned about different types of UML diagrams which include Use Case diagram, Class diagram, Sequence diagram, Sequence diagram, Activity diagram and Statechart diagram.

Finally, I applied these above concepts to a case study: Designing a Note-taking App from Scratch.
