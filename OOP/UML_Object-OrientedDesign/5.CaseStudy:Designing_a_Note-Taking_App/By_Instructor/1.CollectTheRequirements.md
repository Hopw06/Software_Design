# Note-taking App Collecting the Requirements.
## Note-Taking App Features
* Create and edit text-based notes.
* Attach photos.
* Capture hand-drawn sketches.
* Allow protected/sensitive notes.
* Sync app data to Dropbox, iCloud or Google Drive.

## Function Requirements
* We need to build a note-taking app. Users can create an edit text-based notes. A note may also include images or hand-drawn sketches.
* Sensitive notes can be protected from prying eyes using a password.
* The app automatically uploads changes to pre-configured servers. We should support all major platforms: Dropbox, ICloud and Google Drive.

## Non-Function Requirements
* Release our app for iOS first. We'll support iOS 10 and newer versions. The app needs to run on the iPhone and the iPad as well.
* We'll create a dedicated support website and include the link in the app's description and its "About" page.
